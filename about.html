                The initial step began in 2009 The BuukStore is a small bookstore near a famous campus in UK. We are present at several exhibitions at school, campus, religious events etc. Without adequate provisions and even as a small shop, we manage the business with enthusiasm and diligence. With natural and very traditional managerial capabilities, we start a small business number of books and market them to Bookstore Stores in several regions with consignment systems or selling points, which are managed by simple management as well.
